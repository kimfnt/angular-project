# Angular Mini-Project

This project aims to put into practice the course on Angular. This project is a frontend app divided into 4 parts:
* Product list
* User list
* Order list
* Contact form

For the lists, data is collected from json files located stored in the backend and are loaded onto the page as a list.
Once an item is selected, a detailed panel is shown to the user containing all of its information.

The contact form enables users to send a message by entering their email (an alert is displayed, there is no service really sending the form)
